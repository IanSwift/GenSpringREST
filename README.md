# GenSpringREST
Python script to generate a resourceful Spring Boot REST package

This script will generate a RestController, Service, Repository, and (almost empty) Resource for a new package 
inside a Spring Boot project. It is required to have a spring boot project with at least Web and Spring Data JPA 
equivalent starter support in order for this to work. It is also required that you have a python3 
interpreter to run the script. To 
run it, run `GenSpringREST.py` with python in the location of the script. This need not be the same directory 
where you intend to generate the package. Then follow the prompt and a package will be generated for you.
